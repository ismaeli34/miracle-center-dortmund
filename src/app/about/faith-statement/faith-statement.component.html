            <li><strong>The Scriptures:</strong> The Bible is the inspired and authoritative Word of God, serving as our guide for faith and conduct (2 Timothy 3:15-17; 1 Thessalonians 2:13).</li>
            <li><strong>The One True God:</strong> There is one true God, who eternally exists as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Deuteronomy 6:4; Matthew 28:19; Luke 3:22).</li>
            <li><strong>The Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> Jesus is the Son of God, born of a virgin, who lived a sinless life, performed miracles, died on the cross as a substitute for our sins, was physically resurrected, and is now exalted (Matthew 1:23; 1 Corinthians 15:3; Acts 1:9,11; Philippians 2:9-11).</li>
            <li><strong>The Fall of Man:</strong> Humankind was created good but fell through voluntary transgression, resulting in separation from God (Genesis 1:26,27; Romans 5:12-19).</li>
            <li><strong>The Salvation of Man:</strong> Salvation is received through repentance and faith in Jesus Christ, and it is evidenced by a righteous and holy life (Luke 24:47; John 3:3; Romans 8:16; Ephesians 4:24).</li>
            <li><strong>The Ordinances of the Church:</strong> We believe in water baptism and Holy Communion as commanded by the Scriptures (Matthew 28:19; Romans 6:4; 1 Corinthians 11:26).</li>
            <li><strong>The Baptism in the Holy Spirit:</strong> All believers are entitled to the baptism in the Holy Spirit, which is initially evidenced by speaking in tongues and provides power for life and service (Acts 1:4,8; Acts 2:4).</li>
            <li><strong>The Church and Its Mission:</strong> The Church is the body of Christ, commissioned to evangelize the world, worship God, build up believers, and show God's love (Ephesians 1:22,23; Acts 1:8).</li>
            <li><strong>Divine Healing:</strong> Divine healing is an integral part of the gospel, provided for through the atonement (Isaiah 53:4,5; Matthew 8:16,17).</li>
            <li><strong>The Blessed Hope and Final Judgment:</strong> We look forward to the imminent return of Christ, followed by His millennial reign, a final judgment, and a new heavens and a new earth (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Revelation 20:11-15; 2 Peter 3:13).</li>
